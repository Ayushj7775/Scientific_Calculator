# Scientific_Calculator
A scientific calculator is a specialized electronic device designed for performing a wide range of mathematical and scientific calculations. These calculators are used by students, scientists, engineers, and professionals in various fields where precise calculations are required.
Here are some key features and functions commonly found in scientific calculators:

Arithmetic Functions: Scientific calculators can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They also have functions for calculating percentages and square roots.  

Constants: Some models may have built-in constants like Ï€ (pi) and e (Euler's number) for convenience.

Clear and Delete: You can typically clear the display (C or AC) or delete the last entered digit (DEL) as needed.

Display: Basic scientific calculators usually have a single-line or two-line display that shows the input and result.

Trigonometric Functions: They typically offer trigonometric functions such as sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan).


/* Note */
Sin(),cos(),tan() and log() can give error. Little correction is required.
